# PaperWM-redux

`PaperWM-redux` is for a fork of [PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM) that's focused on accelerating development of PaperWM and aims to continue supporting the latest Gnome release(s) by testing and implementing fixes (hopefully quickly!), and implementing new features, now and in the future.

Note this fork 100% supports the PaperWM community!  Every fix/new-feature developed here will **ALWAYS** be provided upstream as pull requests.  Similarly, issues will also be submitted upstream.

Upstream submitted pull requests will continually be merged into this forks's `develop` branch, which may be useful for users that want to use/test this fork for their own use. 

You can always view upstream submitted [issues and pull requests here](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM/issues?q=author%3Ajtaala+).
